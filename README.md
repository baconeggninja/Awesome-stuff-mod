# Awesome stuff mod
A minecraft mod which adds tools and armor that are literally made of pure awesomeness, plus a new dimension!

I have only just started modding, so i am struggling a bit in the big hunks of code, such as the dimension, so help is very welcome!


-Hyperspace
A dimension which is mostly empty exept for random cubes of vanilla generation.
I planned to do this by creating an empty dimension and using generated structures for the cubes, but my lack of understanding of dimensions has made it a whole lot harder.

-Altars, essences and such
The classic elements, earth, water, fire and air, crystallized essence for the ore, generated structures that do nothing but look cool.

-Awesomeness
1 of each essence around a nether star for an unrefined awesomeness, thinking of a cool (but slightly expensive) ritual to refine into pure awesome.

-Boss
A really hard boss that spawns on rare cubes in hyperspace. drops a hyper star, which can be combined with a tool or a peice of armor to unlock an awesome ability unique to that item.
