# Awesome stuff mod
A minecraft mod which adds tools and armor that are literally made of pure awesomeness, plus a new dimension!

I have only just started modding, so i am struggling a bit in the big hunks of code, such as the dimension, so help is very welcome!


-Hyperspace

A dimension which is mostly empty exept for random cubes of vanilla generation.
I plan to do this by creating an empty dimension and using generated structures for the cubes.

-Altars, essences and such

The classic elements, earth, water, fire and air, crystallized essence for the ore, generated structures that do nothing but look cool.

-Awesomeness

1 of each essence around a nether star for an unrefined awesomeness, thinking of a cool (but slightly expensive) ritual to refine into pure awesome.

-Boss

A really hard boss that spawns on rare cubes in hyperspace. drops a hyper star, which can be combined with a tool or a peice of armor to unlock an awesome ability unique to that item.

other random stuff:

-slippery blocks

a block that is really slippery, a block that isn't, and a block that mantains your speed. travelling with awesomeness.

-trees

while wearing the awesome chestplate, you get a great strength buff, and yes, you can pick up trees, and swing them at your enemies.

-miracles

while wearing the the awesome helm, bacon somehow miraculously appears in your hand. awesome.
